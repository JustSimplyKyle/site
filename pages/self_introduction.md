Hi! My name is Kyle. You might see me as "SimplyKyle!" for my online presense.

I'm a High Schooler in Taiwan, being especailly fasicanted by the programming language `Rust`.

My current operating system is "Arch Linux", using the WM `Hyprland`.

# Projects
- **cpsv**: a **C**om**p**ress to **S**et **S**ize video compressor. It's a lightweight wrapper around `ffmpeg` and `av1an`.
- **tetris-with-bevy**: My nascent introduction to game develepoment. Using bevy 0.12 and *NO ASSETS* to create a game using bevy. You can play it [here](https://justsimplykyle.github.io/tetris-with-bevy/)

# Games I Play
- **Minecraft**: Now not so much... but used to be a highly active member in the "Iris Discord Server"
- **Tetris**: My favs are, Tetris Effect Connected Classic Version and tetr.io. I'm fond of classic tetris, tetr.io is sorta a side quest.
- **Nier Automata**: One of the best RPGs I've ever played. The plot is just unbelievable, extermely hard to experience other via video games.
