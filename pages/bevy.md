Making a game is one of the hardest thing I've ever tackled.
Involves:
1. Reading immense amount of books
2. Using a completely different way of thinking
3. Finally, a complete rethink of what life is


# Exmaple Code
```rust
fn main() {
  println!("My life has been a strangled mess, please set me off.");
}
```
